  We have mainly focused on server side stuff, but have also made the basic structure for client-side.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A for HTML</li>
<p>
  We believe we have gained a high level of confidence using HTML, ensuring correct HTML is used with XHTML delivery and occasional use of the validator. We have made sure AngularJS is within the syntax for XHTML.
</p>
<li>A for CSS</li>
<p>
  We believe that we have efficiently used Bootstrap CSS to provide Mobile-First structure and designs. We haven't fully fleshed out our design, but believe we have a high amount of confidence using CSS and specifically the grid system within Bootstrap.
</p>
<li>A for JS</li>
<p>
  We believe that with the use of AngularJS we have complete control and understanding of the client-side, including the use of ui-router to make our website a Single-Page-Application (deals with routing without refreshing but switching views). This has provided us with a MVC design that is helpful in handling interactions. We plan on using the D3.js library for animations but haven't got around to fleshing things like that out yet.

<li>A for Server</li>
<p>
  We believe we have put a lot of effort into our server-side, using the Express framework to create our own, secure API. We have a HTTPS server using SSL certificates (generated using OpenSSL), and have a HTTP server that just re-directs to the HTTPS server. This means POSTs to the API are secure. Passwords are hashed and stored in the embedded database. We are using Token Authentication to keep track of login sessions where we cryptographically sign JSON Web Tokens, encrypted to prevent tampering on the client side. These tokens are stored in Local Storage and we have a client-side helper that checks to make sure the token hasn't expired. These Web Tokens are efficient because they reduce the need to communicate the server constantly to check if the user is logged in. They are also verified on the server when using the API and certificate before accessing protected routes. Our Server is written using Typescript to reduce errors and provide minified JavaScript.
</p>
<li>B for Database</li>
<p>
  We have put our embedded database together with Users, Comments and Pages but haven't finished this yet. We have used SQL to insert, update, delete and get data from the database. All of these functions are stored currently in the server typescript, so will possibly moved to a separate file later on.
</p>
<li>B for Dynamic pages</li>
<p>
  Using services in Angular we pull data from the API using HTTP requests and load this data onto pages client-side. For example, in the My Comments section in the Dashboard all the user's comments are pulled from the API and dynamically loaded into the table. Recently we have written a Markdown parser than converts Markdown into HTML. This will be used so user's can create their own pages written in Markdown. The server parses the Markdown into HTML, and returns the HTML which can just be put straight into a template div.
