- Landing page containing list of data structures & algorithms
- Each, upon click, will give an example of how they work with PNGs / SVGs / animations

## TypeScript

- Using TypeScript to use validation on types so that errors and bugs can be handled more efficiently

## Bootstrap

- Efficient styling options using grids

## D3 ?
