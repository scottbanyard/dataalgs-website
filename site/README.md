# Educational Learning Resource for Data Structures & Algorithms

- Landing page containing list of data structures & algorithms
- Each, upon click, will give an example of how they work with PNGs / SVGs / animations
- User Login to their own account page with tabs for obvious user information (change password etc.), saved material, comments made, subscribed pages (?)
- Options for users to create their own dynamic pages with different (new ?) material, which they can choose to make private or public
- User's could possibly comments & rate different pages

# Reasons for using different languages & libraries:

## TypeScript

- Using TypeScript to use validation on types so that errors and bugs can be handled more efficiently
- JavaScript is very weakly typed and so prone to more errors

## AngularJS

- Very useful for dynamic pages
- Client-Side routing using ui-router allows for a Single-Page-Application, don't need to constantly refresh the page to load a new page, just changes view.

## Bootstrap

- Efficient styling options using grids

## D3.js

- Slick graphics

## SQLITE3

- Embedded database

## XHTML / validation

- XHTML introduces stricter error handling. A lot of current websites are and displayed despite technical errors because of the lack of validation in HTML.

## Express.js

- Easy to setup an API
- Delivers XHTML from HTML pages
- Uses SSL certs / keys to provide a secure HTTPS server to ensure safe data transmission (certs / keys created using openSSL http://www.robpeck.com/2010/10/google-chrome-mac-os-x-and-self-signed-ssl-certificates/#.WM8JaxKLQl4)
- 'Helmet can help protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately. Helmet is actually just a collection of nine smaller middleware functions that set security-related HTTP headers'

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- They can be cryptographically signed and encrypted to prevent tampering on the client side.
